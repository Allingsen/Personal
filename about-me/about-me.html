                        <p> My name is Alex Ellingsen, and I'm from Spokane, Washington. I've always been interested
                            in tech and computers, but really began loving it when I built my first computer when I was 
                            13. I was truly shocked at how such a complex machine could be built so easily, and I have since been  
                            hooked. It wasnt until my senior year of high school that I finally began coding, taking AP Computer Science 
                            and learning basic Java. Since then, I knew my path had to be in software development. I loved how it took the rules of math
                            and the creativity of art and combined them, giving you many different ways to solve the same problem. I'm looking forward to
                            advancing my career in an area I'm so passionate about.
                        </p>
                        <p> In my personal life, I love anything that gets me outdoors. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest gave me countless opporotunities to 
                            escape outdoors in every season. Hiking, camping, and downhill skiing have all continued to be big parts of my life since I was small, and I have
                            recently been getting in to backcountry backpacking, cross-country skiing, and backcountry skiing.
